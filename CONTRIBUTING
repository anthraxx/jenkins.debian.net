== disclaimer

We are happy to take *untested* patches. Patches are reviewed before merging
but noone has a complete test environment for all jobs, so please publish
your well meant and untested patches as soon as they are ready!

=== Contributing code to this project

It's helpful to track fixes or new features via wishlist bugs against the
'jenkins.debian.org' package, eg with the 'reportbug' tool ('devscripts' package).
The BTS will ensure the developers' mailing list
   qa-jenkins-dev@lists.debian.org
is notified.

The code is available in the link:https://anonscm.debian.org/git/qa/jenkins.debian.net.git/tree/[jenkins.debian.net.git repository].

Patches can be submitted as requests to pull from a publicly-visible 
git repository (this is the prefered way) communicated via IRC or mail,
or completly via mail (using git format-patch, see below).
If appropriate, please make a topic branch based on the 'master' branch.

You can send patches or requests to the link:mailto:qa-jenkins-dev@lists.alioth.debian.org[development list],
or to the tracking bug: <bugnumber>@bugs.debian.org.

One possible workflow:
----
  git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/qa/jenkins.debian.net.git
  git checkout origin/master -b <topicname>
  # <edits>
  git commit -a
  git format-patch -M origin/master

  reportbug jenkins.debian.org
  # <describe the issue, attach the patch>
----

=== Contributing bugs to other projects

Another very useful type of contributions are filing bug reports based
on jenkins job runs. Another useful kind of contribution would be to
improve the documentation, eg to better describe how to debug stuff.
