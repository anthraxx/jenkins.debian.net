things to look at on jenkins.d.n. after the upgrade
---------------------------------------------------
kept the jessie versions:
	Configuration file '/etc/default/shorewall'
	Configuration file '/etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf'
	Configuration file '/etc/shorewall6/shorewall6.conf'
	Configuration file '/etc/calamaris/calamaris.conf'
	Configuration file '/etc/apache2/conf-available/security.conf'


when running update_jdn on jenkins
----------------------------------
on shutdown lots of:
	umounting /run/schroot/moznt/jenkins-reproducible-*


pb10
----
had to apt install linux-image-amd64 should go in update_jdn and why is that even neccessary?

update_jdn on pb10:
Problems on profitbricks-build10-amd64.debian.net: adduser: The group `libvirt' does not exist.

update_jdn on pb16:
Problems on profitbricks-build16-i386.debian.net: 30 Jun 11:34:16 ntpdate[5788]: the NTP socket is in use, exiting


update_jdn.sh
-------------
refactor some apt-get install calls away (which used to be needed because of jessie-backports…)


open problems
-------------
- dsa-check-packages points to /bin/true on hosts running in the future
- compare sshd_config from stretch with the one we're using (from jessie)
- check "systemctl -a" for "not found" and failed services, there are more than just haveged
	haveged not running on most i386 and amd64 nodes… (#866513)

no i386 kernels on i386
-----------------------
because of:
#866314: linux-image-4.9.0-3-686-pae: 100+ times slower disk writes on 4.x+/i386/16+RAM, compared to 3.x
amd64 kernel was manually installed with multiarch, should go into update_jdn
also on pb3+4+9 I had to do: sudo apt install linux-image-amd64


to be done once all hosts run stretch: squid
--------------------------------------------
2) delete /etc/squid3 and /var/log/squid3 from the hosts
4) apt purge squid3 (this will probably take care of ↑)

to be done once all hosts run stretch: sshd_config
--------------------------------------------------
/etc/ssh/sshd_config - the currently running one is the one from jessie, we should update_jdn to the one from stretch
